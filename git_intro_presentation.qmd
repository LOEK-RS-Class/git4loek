### Code Availability

The code to reproduce the results presented in this study can be accessed at: https://github.com/LOEK-RS/global_applicability. The methods for the forward variable selection, area of applicability and dissimilarity index calibration are implemented in the R package ‘CAST’: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CAST/index.html. [@Ludwig2023]

### Providing Software

All newly produced R functions and modelling steps are fully documented in [https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST](https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST). [@Meyer2018]
