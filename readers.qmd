## Collaboration with git and GitHub

There are excellent workshop resources by the [US National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) on how to use git, GitHub and RStudio for collaborative research: [https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/lter/github-workshop/index.html](https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/lter/github-workshop/index.html)

They also go through the basic git concept, but also tackle more collaboration specific topics like [merge conflicts](https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/lter/github-workshop/appendix-a-merge-conflicts.html#what-is-a-merge-conflict) and [forks](https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/lter/github-workshop/appendix-c-forks.html#what-is-a-fork).
