## Publishing

![](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/journal-banners/14668238-1501384690490.jpg){height=50}

### Methods Article

Presentation of **new analytical techniques, new software, etc.,** or critical evaluation of methods in macroecology. Typically, these papers do not exceed ten printed pages.


### Open Research

[Global Ecology and Biogeography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14668238/homepage/forauthors.html) supports open research, therefore expects that the data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate public repository, [...] **Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived in a repository**

## Version Control and Code Sharing

![Version Control](screenshots/files_git.png){height=100px fig-align="left"}


### Code Availability

The code to reproduce the results presented in this study can be accessed at: https://github.com/LOEK-RS/global_applicability. The methods for the forward variable selection, area of applicability and dissimilarity index calibration are implemented in the R package ‘CAST’: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CAST/index.html. [@Ludwig2023]

### Providing Software

All newly produced R functions and modelling steps are fully documented in https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/CAST. [@Meyer2018]



## git

* Version Control System
* Developed by Linus Torvalds to work on the Linux Kernel with multiple people
* Mainly for Code, but useful for many other things

* Command Line Tool
* GUI Versions available
* RStudio Integration
* Application with a learning curve
* Simple but easy to mess something up
* Core unit: **A repository**


```
git init    # to start
```


```
git status # to get infos

git add    # to add files to the tracking system

git commit # to define changed files as the new standard
```

## GitHub

![](https://logosmarken.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GitHub-Logo.png){height=100px}

* Cloud Storage for git repositories
* platform for code sharing, documentation, (data)...
* collaboration and (scientific) communication


### GitHub Pages!!

* Wiki
* Issue - Tracker
* Automation
* ...


## GitHub
