## R package: CAST
    
[https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST](https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST)


In R, you can directly install the package from GitHub using the following commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST")

remotes::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST")
```

The `install.packages` function by default downloads and installs packages from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) which in itself is a repository for R packages and their version management.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("CAST")
```
